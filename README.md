# Millercodes
All of the projects I developed while working with millercodes.  The earlier games require pygame to run.  Instructions on how to install pygame can be found here: http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=foreword&lang=en#section_0   Look in section 0.1.1 for windows installation, and 0.1.2 for mac installation.
