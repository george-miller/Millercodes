# Millercodes
All of the projects I developed while working with millercodes.  The earlier games require pygame to run.  Instructions on how to install pygame can be found here: http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=foreword&lang=en#section_0   Look in section 0.1.1 for windows installation, and 0.1.2 for mac installation.

Each project is seperated into two folders, one representing the code before I started working on it, and then the other representing the code after I finished a week of work on it.  We did this as a round robin excersize to get a feel for how each other codes, and as a way to brainstorm game ideas and see the challenges of a certain game's implementation.
